# Introduction

Every year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publishes
the FARS, a census of all vehicle collision deaths on public roads. The
basis for the FARS data is a partnership between the states and the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to collect data on all
qualifying fatalities. Death certificates are the source of race and
ethnicity information. (Matthew & Ernani, 2022). For a collision to be
covered by FARS, it must include a motor vehicle operating on a road
that is normally accessible to the general public and must cause the
death of one or more individuals---either non-motorists or occupants of
the vehicle---within 30 days of the collision. In order to help identify
traffic safety issues, provide an objective foundation for assessing the
efficacy of motor vehicle safety regulations and highway safety
initiatives, and provide an overall measure of highway safety, the U.S.
Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (DOT, NHTSA) developed the Framework for Assessment of
Road Safety (FARS) in 1975 (DOT/NHTSA, n.d.).

This PROJECT analyzes data on traffic accidents in 2019, 2020, and 2021
to derive the relationship between traffic accidents and gender, age,
address, time period and harm types.

This project includes the following:

1.  Data collection: Collect comprehensive data on traffic accidents for
    2019, 2020 and 2021. This data should include details of the
    individuals involved (gender, age), location accident status
    (address), and time of occurrence.

<!-- -->

2.  Data cleaning and preparation: standardize and clean the data to
    ensure consistency. This may involve dealing with missing values,
    correcting data entry errors, and formatting data for analysis.

3.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Descriptive analysis: generating
    statistics to understand the basic characteristics of the data, such
    as the total number of accidents per year, the distribution of
    accidents by gender and age, and the geographic distribution of
    accidents. Temporal analysis: examines trends over time, e.g.,
    changes in accident frequency over a three-year period or over a
    specific time period, e.g., daily peaks, daytime versus nighttime.

4.  Correlation analysis:

    Gender analysis: investigates how gender affects the likelihood or
    severity of traffic crashes.

    Age analysis: to determine whether certain age groups are more
    likely to be involved in traffic accidents.

    Geospatial analysis: analyzes whether certain addresses or areas
    (this PROJECT focuses specifically on New Jersey and compares it to
    the U.S. as a whole) have higher accident rates, potentially
    identifying high-risk areas.

    Temporal analysis: exploring the relationship between different
    times of the day (hours of the day, months of the year (this project
    differentiates the year with 4 quarters)) and accident rates.

    Type analysis: Analysis of the frequency of the types of accidents,
    the difference between the types with higher frequency of accidents
    in the three years.

5.  Insights and recommendations: Derive insights from the analysis. For
    example, determine if certain demographics are at greater risk or if
    certain times or locations are associated with higher crash rates.
    Based on these findings, develop recommendations for traffic safety
    improvements or targeted campaigns.

6.  Reporting and Visualization: Detailed descriptions of the findings
    are accompanied by visualizations such as charts, heat maps, and
    graphs to make the data easy to understand.

## Reading and cleaning the data, prepare data to analysis

### Clean and select accident data

```{r}
# read files accident form 2021, 2020 and 2019 and combine them in one file call that accident_all
accident_2019 <- read.csv("accident_2019.csv")
accident_2020 <- read.csv("accident_2020.csv")
accident_2021 <- read.csv("accident_2021.csv")

accident_2019[] <- lapply(accident_2019, as.character)
accident_2020[] <- lapply(accident_2020, as.character)
accident_2021[] <- lapply(accident_2021, as.character)

accident_2019$YEAR <- 2019
accident_2020$YEAR <- 2020
accident_2021$YEAR <- 2021

# merge data
accident_all <- bind_rows(accident_2019, accident_2020, accident_2021)

# data cleaning: remove missing information from data to reduce interference with data analysis
accident_all <- accident_all %>% filter(complete.cases(.) & !apply(., 1, function(x) any(x == "")))

# select data: This project focuses on the trend of traffic harm types of accident over 3 years, so HARM_EVNAME and YEAR selected.
accident_all <- accident_all %>%
  select(HARM_EVNAME,YEAR)

head(accident_all)

```

### Clean and select person data

```{r}
# read files accident form 2021, 2020 and 2019 and combine them in one file call that accident_all
person_2019 <- read.csv("person_2019.csv")
person_2020 <- read.csv("person_2020.csv")
person_2021 <- read.csv("person_2021.csv")

person_2019[] <- lapply(person_2019, as.character)
person_2020[] <- lapply(person_2020, as.character)
person_2021[] <- lapply(person_2021, as.character)

person_2019$YEAR <- 2019
person_2020$YEAR <- 2020
person_2021$YEAR <- 2021

# merge data
person_all <- bind_rows(person_2019, person_2020, person_2021)

# data cleaning: remove missing information from data to reduce interference with data analysis
person_all <- person_all %>% 
              # Remove rows with any empty strings in key columns
              filter(!apply(select(., AGE, SEXNAME, STATENAME, YEAR, MONTH,HOUR, DEATH_YR), 1, function(x) any(x == ""))) %>%
              # Convert AGE to numeric 
              mutate(AGE = as.numeric(AGE)) %>%
              # Remove rows where AGE data is wrong which is greater than 900
              filter(AGE <= 900)


# select data: This project focuses on the relationship between traffic accidents and gender, age, address, and time of accident, so AGE,SEXNAME,STATENAME,YEAR,MONTH,DEATH_YR were selected.
person_all <- person_all %>%
  select(AGE,SEXNAME,STATENAME,YEAR,MONTH,HOUR,DEATH_YR)

head(person_all)
```

# The relationship between gender and traffic accidents

## Compare the proportion of men and women involved in accidents

```{r}
# Grouping by Gender and count how many men and women 
table(person_all$SEXNAME)
person_all<-person_all|> 
  mutate(gender= case_when(
SEXNAME=="Female"~"Female",
SEXNAME=="Male"~"Male",
TRUE~"Unknown"))
total_gender <- person_all %>%
  group_by(SEXNAME) %>%
  summarise(Total = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

gender_with_percentages <- person_all %>%
                          group_by(gender) %>%
                          summarise(Count = n()) %>%
                          mutate(Percentage = (Count / sum(Count)) * 100)

# Tidy up the table
gender_with_percentages <- gender_with_percentages %>%
                          mutate(Percentage = round(Percentage, 2))

# print the result
kable(gender_with_percentages)


```

1.  There are a total of 84,526 cases involving females, which accounts
    for 32.64% of the dataset.

2.  There are a total of 173,978 cases involving males, which accounts
    for 67.18% of the dataset.

    From this data, we can see that a significantly larger portion of
    the dataset consists of males. Males are more frequently involved in
    accidents than females.

## Compare the percentage of Survived between male and female

```{r}
# Count the number and proportion of Survived for each gender
person_all<-person_all|> mutate(Death= 
                case_when(
DEATH_YR%in%c(2019,2020,2021,2022)~"Died",
DEATH_YR==8888~"Survived", TRUE~"Unknown"))

# Reshaping the data
survived_gender_wide <- person_all %>%
  filter(Death == "Survived", SEXNAME %in% c("Female", "Male")) %>%
  group_by(YEAR, SEXNAME) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(Percent = round((Count / sum(Count)) * 100, 1)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = SEXNAME, values_from = c(Count, Percent), 
              names_sep = "_", values_fill = list(Count = 0, Percent = 0))

# Format the table using kable
kable(survived_gender_wide, col.names = c("Year", "Survived Male Count", "Survived Female Count", "Survived Male Percent", "Survived Female Percent"))


```

Women have a higher survival rate than men.

# Comparing data for the US and NJ (age)

## Compare the average age of people of New Jersey accident data to the US data

```{r}
# Prepare the New Jersey dataset
person_nj <- filter(person_all, STATENAME == "New Jersey")
person_nj$Group <- "New Jersey"

# Prepare the overall dataset with a Group column
person_all$Group <- "US"

# Combine the data
combined_data <- rbind(person_all[, c("AGE", "Group")], person_nj[, c("AGE", "Group")])

# Calculate mean ages
mean_ages <- combined_data %>%
             group_by(Group) %>%
             summarise(MeanAge = mean(AGE, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create the boxplot with mean age highlighted
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Group, y = AGE, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = mean_ages, aes(x = Group, y = MeanAge, group = Group), 
             color = "red", size = 3, shape = 18) +
  geom_text(data = mean_ages, aes(x = Group, y = MeanAge, label = round(MeanAge, 1)), 
            vjust = -1, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Ages: US vs. New Jersey", x = "Group", y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()

```

1.  The horizontal line within each box represents the median age for
    both groups: person_nj (New Jersey) and person_all (United States).
    The relatively similar medians indicate that the average age of
    individuals involved in accidents in New Jersey and the United
    States as a whole is almost the same.

2.  The center 50% of the data are included in the interquartile range
    (IQR), which is shown by the boxes. The equal magnitude of the IQRs
    for the two groups suggests that the middle 50% of cases in both
    datasets have a similar age distribution.

3.  There appears to be little variation in the general age distribution
    based on the "whiskers" of the boxplot, which show the range of the
    data excluding outliers.

4.  There do not appear to be any outliers indicated, which would show
    data points that fall significantly outside the typical range.

Overall, the average age of people involved in accidents in New Jersey
does not differ significantly from the national average.

## Compare the age group with the highest concentration of accidents in New Jersey and the United States

```{r}
# Function to categorize age into segments
categorize_age <- function(age) {
  cut(age,
      breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),
      include.lowest = TRUE,
      right = FALSE,
      labels = paste(seq(0, 90, by = 10), seq(9, 99, by = 10), sep = "-"))
}

# Categorize age into segments for both datasets
person_all <- person_all %>%
  mutate(AGE_GROUP = categorize_age(AGE))

person_nj <- person_nj %>%
  mutate(AGE_GROUP = categorize_age(AGE))

# Calculate the percentage of each age group for the US
age_group_percentage_us <- person_all %>%
  count(AGE_GROUP) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(Percentage))

# Calculate the percentage of each age group for NJ
age_group_percentage_nj <- person_nj %>%
  count(AGE_GROUP) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(Percentage))

# Find the age group with the highest concentration of accidents for US and NJ
top_age_group_us <- age_group_percentage_us[1, ]
top_age_group_nj <- age_group_percentage_nj[1, ]

# Compare the top age groups
comparison <- rbind(
  data.frame(Location = "US", top_age_group_us),
  data.frame(Location = "NJ", top_age_group_nj)
)

# Print the comparison
kable(comparison)

```

The age group with the highest concentration of accidents in New Jersey
and the United States is 20 to 29 years old, and the proportion is
close.

1.  High-risk age group: The 20-29 age group is usually associated with
    young people. This group may exhibit a higher level of risk-taking
    behavior, which may lead to a higher rate of accidents. This is a
    trend in New Jersey and across the United States.

2.  Consistency across regions: New Jersey has similar rates to the rest
    of the U.S., which means that the factors contributing to this trend
    are not unique to New Jersey, but are likely to be prevalent....

3.  Research on influencing factors: Further research into why the 20-29
    age group is accident prone may be helpful. Factors may include
    inexperience, overconfidence, higher rates of drunk driving or
    greater exposure to high-risk driving situations.

# The association of the time period and traffic accident

## Count the 4-hour periods in which traffic accidents occur most frequently

```{r}
# Function to map hours to the four-hour intervals
map_to_interval <- function(hour) {
  # Extract the starting hour from the HOURNAME string
  start_hour <- as.numeric(str_extract(hour, "^\\d+"))
  
  # Define the intervals
  if (start_hour >= 0 & start_hour < 4) {
    return("0:00am-3:59am")
  } else if (start_hour >= 4 & start_hour < 8) {
    return("4:00am-7:59am")
  } else if (start_hour >= 8 & start_hour < 12) {
    return("8:00am-11:59am")
  } else if (start_hour >= 12 & start_hour < 16) {
    return("12:00pm-3:59pm")
  } else if (start_hour >= 16 & start_hour < 20) {
    return("4:00pm-7:59pm")
  } else if (start_hour >= 20 & start_hour < 24) {
    return("8:00pm-11:59pm")
  } else {
    return("Unknown")
  }
}

# Apply the function to group 'HOURNAME' into four-hour intervals
person_all <- person_all %>%
  mutate(Interval = sapply(HOUR, map_to_interval))

# Count the occurrences of each interval and calculate the percentage
interval_counts <- person_all %>%
  count(Interval, name = "Count") %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

# Tidy the table
interval_counts <- interval_counts %>%
                          mutate(Percentage = round(Percentage, 2))

# View the results
kable(interval_counts)

# Create a pie chart with percentage labels and interval names
pie_chart <- ggplot(interval_counts, aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Interval)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Interval, "\n", round(Percentage, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Interval", title = "Frequency of accidents during 4-hour periods") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


# Print the pie chart
print(pie_chart)

```

1.  Peak Hours: The intervals from 4:00 pm to 7:59 pm and from 8:00 pm
    to 11:59 pm have the highest counts, indicating that these time
    periods are peak hours for the accidents occured. This could suggest
    higher activity levels or increased risk during these times.

2.  Day vs. Night: There is a noticeable decrease in counts during the
    late night to early morning hours (0:00 am to 3:59 am), which may
    indicate lower activity levels or that fewer accidents are occured
    during these hours.

3.  Afternoon Activity: The interval from 12:00 pm to 3:59 pm also has a
    significant count, which could correspond to afternoon activities or
    occurrences.

4.  Morning Hours: The intervals from 8:00 am to 11:59 am and from 4:00
    am to 7:59 am have lower counts compared to the afternoon and
    evening hours. This may reflect a slower start to the day for the
    events being recorded or may indicate that the risk or activity is
    lower during these times.

## Frequency of car accidents per quarter

```{r}
# Create a new variable 'Quarter' by mapping 'MONTH' to quarters
person_all <- person_all %>%
  mutate(Quarter = case_when(
    MONTH %in% 1:3 ~ "Quarter_1",
    MONTH %in% 4:6 ~ "Quarter_2",
    MONTH %in% 7:9 ~ "Quarter_3",
    MONTH %in% 10:12 ~ "Quarter_4",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"  # For any data that might not fit the above criteria
  ))

# Count the occurrences of each quarter and calculate the percentage
quarter_counts <- person_all %>%
  count(Quarter, name = "Count") %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

# Tidy the table
quarter_counts <- quarter_counts %>%
                          mutate(Percentage = round(Percentage, 2))

# View the results
kable(quarter_counts)

# Create a pie chart with labels for each section
ggplot(quarter_counts, aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Quarter)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%s: %.1f%%", Quarter, Percentage)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.3)) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(fill = "Quarter", title = "Frequency of accidents during quarters") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

1.  Quarter 3 (Q3) has the highest count: With 72,247 occurrences,
    making up 27.90% of the total, this suggests that the events being
    recorded happen most frequently during the months of July, August,
    and September.

2.  Quarter 4 (Q4) follows closely: With 68,554	occurrences and 26.47%
    of the total, indicating that October, November, and December are
    also high-activity months.

3.  Quarter 2 (Q2) is the next: Having 64,027 occurrences with 24.72% of
    the total, which includes the months of April, May, and June.

4.  Quarter 1 (Q1) has the fewest occurrences: With 54,134	 occurrences
    accounting for 20.90% of the total, which suggests that January,
    February, and March are the least active months.

It might indicate seasonal patterns in driving behavior or road
conditions that could lead to higher incidents in Q3 and Q4.

## Table of frequency of occurrence of the time period in each quarter

```{r}
# Calculate the total number of accidents for each quarter
total_accidents_per_quarter <- person_all %>%
  group_by(Quarter) %>%
  summarise(Total_Count = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Now, for each quarter, find the 4-hour period with the highest frequency of accidents
most_frequent_intervals <- person_all %>%
  group_by(Quarter, Interval) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(Quarter, desc(Count))

# Merge the total counts back into the most frequent intervals
most_frequent_intervals <- most_frequent_intervals %>%
  left_join(total_accidents_per_quarter, by = "Quarter")

# Calculate the percentage
most_frequent_intervals <- most_frequent_intervals %>%
  mutate(Percentage = (Count / Total_Count) * 100)

# Get the top interval for each quarter with the percentage
top_intervals_by_quarter <- most_frequent_intervals %>%
  group_by(Quarter) %>%
  slice_max(n = 1, order_by = Count) %>%
  ungroup()

# Tidy the table
top_intervals_by_quarter <- top_intervals_by_quarter %>%
                          mutate(Percentage = round(Percentage, 2))

# Print the results
kable(top_intervals_by_quarter)

```

Analysis based on the information of the table:

1.  Quarter 1 (Q1): The 4:00 pm to 7:59 pm interval had the highest
    frequency of car accidents, with 13,779	accidents, constituting
    25.45% of the total accidents in Q1.

2.  Quarter 2 (Q2): The interval with the highest number of accidents
    was from 8:00 pm to 11:59 pm, with 14,496 accidents, which is 22.64%
    of Q2's total.

3.  Quarter 3 (Q3): This quarter also saw the highest number of
    accidents in the 8:00 pm to 11:59 pm interval, with 16,799
    accidents, making up 23.25% of the total for Q3.

4.  Quarter 4 (Q4): The 4:00 pm to 7:59 pm interval was the most
    accident-prone, with 18,893 accidents, representing 27.56% of Q4's
    total accidents.

Analysis reveals several patterns and potential insights:

1.  The intervals of 4:00 pm to 7:59 pm and 8:00 pm to 11:59 pm are
    consistently the most accident-prone across all quarters, suggesting
    that the later afternoon to late evening may be the riskiest times
    for car accidents.
2.  Quarter 4 shows the highest percentage (27.55%) of accidents in the
    peak interval compared to other quarters, which could be influenced
    by factors such as early darkness in the winter months, holiday
    traffic, or other seasonal factors.
3.  The fact that the 8:00 pm to 11:59 pm interval is the peak in Q2 and
    Q3 could suggest that summer evening activities contribute to the
    higher accident rates during these hours.
4.  Quarter 1 has the lowest percentage of accidents in its peak
    interval, indicating perhaps more evenly distributed accident
    occurrences throughout the day or less pronounced peaks compared to
    other quarters.

# Trends in traffic accidents over three years

## Compare the number of accidents in 2019, 2020, and 2021, observe the trend of total number of accidents over three years.

```{r}
num_2019 <- nrow(accident_2019)
num_2020 <- nrow(accident_2020)
num_2021 <- nrow(accident_2021)

# Creating a data frame with the correct name
accident_num <- data.frame(
  Year = c("2019", "2020", "2021"),
  Number_of_accident = c(num_2019, num_2020, num_2021)
)

# Create a table 
kable(accident_num, caption = "Number of Rows in Accident Data (2019-2021)", format = "html")

# Create the combined bar and line chart using ggplot2
ggplot(accident_num, aes(x = Year, y = Number_of_accident, group = 1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +  # Bar chart
  geom_line(color = "red", linewidth = 1) +  # Line chart with updated linewidth
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +  # Points for line chart
  geom_text(aes(label = Number_of_accident), vjust = -0.5) +  # Annotate with number of accidents
  labs(title = "Number of Accidents (2019-2021)", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Accidents") +
  theme_minimal()


```

1.  The number of accidents (or records) appears to increase each year.
2.  There is a clear upward trend in the data, with the number of
    accidents in 2021 being the highest, followed by 2020, and then 2019
    having the least.

This trend could indicate various things: An actual increase in the
number of accidents year over year. Improved reporting or data
collection methods over the years, leading to more incidents being
recorded.

## The trend of 5 types with the highest frequency of traffic accidents

```{r}
# Modified function to get top 5 types and group others
count_harm_evname <- function(data) {
  total <- nrow(data)
  top_types <- data %>%
    count(HARM_EVNAME) %>%
    mutate(Percentage = n / total * 100) %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    head(5)

  others <- data %>%
    count(HARM_EVNAME) %>%
    filter(!(HARM_EVNAME %in% top_types$HARM_EVNAME)) %>%
    summarise(HARM_EVNAME = "Other", n = sum(n), Percentage = sum(n) / total * 100)

  bind_rows(top_types, others)
}


# Apply function to each dataset
counts_2019 <- count_harm_evname(accident_2019)
counts_2020 <- count_harm_evname(accident_2020)
counts_2021 <- count_harm_evname(accident_2021)

# Add a Year column to each dataset for identification
counts_2019$Year <- 2019
counts_2020$Year <- 2020
counts_2021$Year <- 2021

# Combine the counts into one data frame for comparison

The top 5 types of accidents in the three years were all "Motor Vehicle
in-transport","Pedestrian", "Rollover/Overturn", "Tree (Standing Only)",
"Curb". These five types of accidents account for a similar proportion
of accidents each year.

1.  There may be a pattern or consistency in the causes of accidents, as
    evidenced by the fact that the top 5 categories of accidents did not
    change over a period of three years. This suggests that the causes
    of these mishaps are ongoing and are not greatly impacted by yearly
    fluctuations.

2.  Priority Areas for Safety Interventions: Setting priorities for
    safety measures and interventions can be aided by understanding the
    most typical accident types. For instance, if there is a persistent
    high rate of "Pedestrian" and "Motor Vehicle in-transport"
    accidents, it suggests that pedestrian-friendly infrastructure,
    awareness programs, and enhanced road safety measures are required.

3.  The terms 'Rollover/Overturn' and 'Tree (Standing Only)' imply that
    environmental variables, such as road conditions near trees, and
    vehicle stability are major causes of accidents. This may suggest
    that road upkeep and car safety regulations need to be improved.

4.  The frequency of "Curb"-related accidents suggests that there may be
    problems with urban planning or road design. It might be helpful to
    look into if the layout of the curbs and walkways, insufficient
    signage, or poor visibility are to blame for these incidents.

5.  The fact that the percentage of these incidents is consistent year
    after year indicates that the hazards are still present and that
    neither the effectiveness of safety measures put in place over the
    years nor the conduct of drivers or pedestrians has significantly
    changed.

6.  To comprehend the underlying causes of these mishaps, further
    focused study may be conducted using the information provided here.
    It can also help politicians create more targeted plans to lower
    these particular kinds of mishaps.

7.  Educating the public about the most prevalent types of accidents
    might encourage drivers and pedestrians to drive more cautiously. To
    lessen their incidence, educational initiatives may concentrate on
    these particular situations.

8.  Given the typical accident types, it may be possible to create
    technology solutions specialized to these situations, such as
    advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which target these
    accident kinds.

1.  There's an initial increase from 2019 to 2020.
2.  The count of "Motor Vehicle in-transport" for 2021 shows a
    significant rise from 2020, indicating a sharp increase in the
    number of "Motor Vehicle In-Transport" accidents reported or
    recorded.

This trend of "Motor Vehicle in-transport" could imply several
things: 1. An actual increase in the number of such accidents year over
year. 2. Changes in data collection or reporting practices, leading to
more incidents being captured in the data. 3. An increase in the number
of vehicles on the road or changes in transportation patterns.

The trend could be concerning, signaling a growing issue that may
require attention from policy-makers or transportation authorities.

# Conclusion

1.  Gender differences in accidents: Males accounted for a larger
    proportion of accidents at 65.84%, followed by females at 32.01% and
    unknown gender at 2.15%, with females having a higher survival rate
    in accidents.

2.  New Jersey and the U.S. have the highest concentration of accidents
    in the 20-29 age group, and the average age of those involved in
    accidents is similar. Suggesting that New Jersey has similar rates
    to the rest of the U.S. means that contributing to this trend is
    likely to be widespread.

3.  Peak Accident Hours:Peak accident hours are 4:00 p.m. to 7:59 p.m.
    and 8:00 p.m. to 11:59 p.m., which indicate higher activity levels
    or higher risk. Counts were reduced during the day compared to the
    night, while activity between 12:00 PM and 3:59 PM was significant.
    Lower counts in the morning may reflect slower starts or lower risk.

4.  Seasonal variation in traffic accidents: The data show seasonal
    trends, with the highest frequency of traffic accidents occurring in
    the third quarter (July-September) and the fourth quarter
    (October-December). This can be attributed to increased summer and
    holiday travel, as well as poor weather conditions affecting driving
    safety in the fourth quarter. Enhanced traffic safety measures and
    controls are needed. Initiatives may include increased enforcement
    efforts and public safety activities designed to anticipate and
    mitigate increased risk.

5.  Annual accident trend: Persistent high rates of certain types of
    crashes over the years indicate underlying systemic problems.
    Assessing crash frequency and type can assist the transportation
    sector in developing and implementing strategic interventions to
    minimize crashes. For example, addressing the issue of
    "rollover/flip". Accidents may require a review of vehicle safety
    standards and road design.

6.  Informed decision-making through data visualization Clear
    visualization of accident data helps decision-makers to quickly
    identify and prioritize safety issues, underscoring the importance
    of reliable data collection and representation in policy
    development. Gaining insight into the timing and nature of crashes
    and understanding crash trends can help to take proactive measures
    to anticipate potential future crash hotspots and periods of
    elevated risk, and predictive analytics can help to better allocate
    resources and emergency response plans, which can ensure
    preparedness during periods of high risk.
